# 7speaking murder

**Subject: Urgent - Top Priority Investigation**

**To:** You, Esteemed MI6 Operative

**From:** Director "M"

**Situation:** A shadow has fallen upon Projet Voltaire. Their administrator has been found murdered. This is not merely a tragedy; it's a potential breach of national security. Projet Voltaire holds sensitive information, and we must identify the perpetrator before further damage is done.

**Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It:**

Assume the identity of a seasoned MI6 detective. Your objective is to unmask the killer of the Projet Voltaire admin. The clock is ticking.

**Phase 1: The 7Speaking Connection**

Our initial intelligence suggests a link between the victim and 7Speaking, another organization. Your first task is to infiltrate 7Speaking's digital fortress and identify the individual responsible for their system administration. Obtain their password – it may hold a vital clue to the killer's identity or motives.

**Time Constraint:** You have a strict 15-minute window to solve this case. Every second counts.

**Intel Assistance:**

*   For the first 5 minutes of each stage of your investigation, a cryptic hint will be provided. Pay close attention – it could be the key to unlocking the truth.
*   Remember, a keen eye and sharp deductive reasoning are your greatest assets.

**Important Directive:**

Any use of automated website scanning tools will be considered a violation of protocol and will result in immediate mission failure. This investigation demands human intelligence, not brute force.

**Failure is Not an Option.** The security of our nation depends on your success. Good luck, Agent.

**Need Backup?** The solution, if absolutely necessary, can be found later in the "readme" file (but we trust you won't need it).

This is a great start! Here are a few suggestions to further enhance the "readme" and immerse the user in the detective experience:

**Enhancements for Immersion:**

*   **Personalize the "M" Communication:** Instead of a generic "Director 'M'", consider adding a line or two that hints at a past working relationship with the player-detective. Something like: "Agent [Player's Assumed Name], your track record speaks for itself, which is why I'm assigning you to this sensitive case."
*   **Elaborate on the Stakes:** Instead of just saying "potential breach of national security," give a *tiny* glimpse of what that might entail. "Projet Voltaire's databases contain encrypted linguistic analysis critical to understanding potential foreign influence campaigns." Or, "The victim was close to a breakthrough in identifying a network of deepfake propagandists." (Make it sound plausible but mysterious).
*   **Sensory Details:** Sprinkle in a few details that appeal to the senses. For example, after "The clock is ticking," add: "The stale coffee in your MI6-issued mug has long gone cold, but you barely notice." Or, "The digital glow of the screen illuminates the grim set of your jaw."
*   **Consequences of Failure:** Make the threat of failure more tangible. "If the killer isn't found quickly, the information could be leaked, undermining years of covert operations."
*   **Hint Teasers (Without Giving Spoilers):** Instead of *just* saying there will be a hint, give a very vague idea of what form it might take. "The hint may be hidden in plain sight or disguised within seemingly innocuous code." Or, "The hint will appear as a subtle anomaly - trust your instincts."
*   **A Final, Noir-ish Touch:** End the "readme" with a line that reinforces the detective atmosphere. "The truth is out there, Agent. Go find it." Or, "Justice demands answers. Let's get to work."

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
